## Design Choices ##

### Fonts ###

We have chosen [Josefin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans?query=jose#standard-styles) for all of the headers and [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=ralew#standard-styles) the rest of the text.  We have used a [Caveat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat?query=caveat) font for the logo and headlines throughout the site.

### Colours ###

We have chosen the colour that say ... appealing to the eye and also compliments the design of the project.
![Colour palette](wireframes/Palette.png)

- *Grullo* (AF9483) - Light soft brown
- *Umber* (615550) - Dark brown
- *Alabaster* (F0EDE5) - Off white

These colours will compliment each other well when used across the site creating pleasant ambience.

### Wireframes ###

We designed our site mock-ups using [balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). We were focusing on defining basic layout structure of the site and identifying how displays would change on different screen sizes such as [mobile](/wireframes/mobile.jpg), [tablet](/wireframes/tablet.jpg) and [desktop](/wireframes/desktop.jpg).

- In the top navigation clicked **settings**.
- Scrolled down to the **GitHub Pages** area.
- Selected **Master Branch** from the **Source** dropdown menu.
- Clicked to **confirm** my **selection**.
- [repo name](https://simonjvardy.github.io/[repo name]/) is now **live** on **GitHub Pages**.

### Running [repo name] Locally ###

Cloning [repo name] from GitHub:

- Navigate to **simonjvardy/[repo name here]**.
